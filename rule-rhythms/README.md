## Haskell Sound Experiment with Rule 110

This experiment explores the generation of sound based on the evolution of a one-dimensional cellular automaton, specifically Rule 110. This was undertaken as a learning exercise to better understand the Haskell programming language. The sound generation code is largely inspired by and borrowed from Tsoding's work.

### What's Being Tried Here

The goal is to translate the patterns generated by Rule 110 into audible frequencies. 
This project attempts to "sonify" the visual patterns of Rule 110, allowing you to hear the evolution of the cellular automaton as a sequence of musical notes or tones. The command-line arguments provide flexibility in controlling the frequency range and the tempo/duration of the resulting sound.

The generated audio data (a sequence of floating-point numbers representing the waveform) is saved to a binary file (`output.bin`). The `play` function uses `ffplay` (which needs to be installed on your system) to play the generated audio file. Samples of the the generate sounds can be listened [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pr3FSWEWkA).


### Usage

```
cabal run rule-rhythms -- --duration=0.25 --start=500.0 --stop=2000.0 --step=100 --repeat=10
```
