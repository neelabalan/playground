# Merkle-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem

This is a basic implementation of the cryptosystem. 

### Why do this?

I got inspired after reading `Information Security - Principles and Practice` by *Mark Stamp*
where the author elegantly explains the public key cryptography and the steps to implement the above system. 

This system was later broken by *Adi Shamir* in the year 1982. 

I've noticed later on, Lot of papers were published on improving the system and also papers published on attacking the system using cyrptanalysis and quantum computing algorithms.
